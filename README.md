### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Torrence!

I'm currently a Junior Front End Developer primarily engaged in building projects using Vue.js and React.js. Check out the toolset in the next section to see that other technologies that I have proficiency in.

In my professional career, I've taken on projects that involved building out a custom Interface for a Mobile Content Management system using a cross-platform Framework. In addition, I recently just completed the first iteration of a Operations Management System for a client built using Vue.js. 

I have a passion for Design + everything Front End Development and have the goal of working with Sustainable Technologies in my professional career. I like to share my knowledge and experiences with others! Currently plan on a taking part time role as a JavaScript tutor.
